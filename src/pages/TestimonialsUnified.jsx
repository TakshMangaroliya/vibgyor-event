      "We had the absolute best experience working with Eventrics for our multi-day destination wedding in Florida. From the very beginning—two years before our big day—their team was by our side, helping us navigate every step of the planning process. Our main planner, Abigail, was a true rockstar. She was organized, timely, and worked tirelessly to find the perfect vendors within our budget who could also bring our vision to life. No request was too big, no detail too small. When issues arose with our hotel/venue and a conference, she worked relentlessly to sort out the mess. Then, two hurricanes threatened our events, and she didn't miss a beat—ensuring our welcome party and welcome boat experience were still perfect. Throughout the wedding weekend, Abigail and Whitney were behind the scenes, handling logistics, keeping vendors on schedule, and making sure we never had to stress. Brittany and Mercedes stepped in to capture behind-the-scenes clips and created amazing reels for us. After the wedding, Mercedes continued her magic, handling submissions to wedding publications and sharing our special moments. The level of care, effort, and dedication this team put into making our wedding weekend magical and stress-free is something we will forever be grateful for. We would absolutely recommend them again in a heartbeat.",

Their incredible level of organization, responsiveness, and professionalism made our wedding weekend one of the best weekends of our lives and a truly memorable weekend for our guests. Every event was flawlessly executed (despite last minute venue changes due to weather) with meticulous attention to detail and minimal involvement from us or our families. We can't recommend them enough for an stress-free, and enjoyable wedding planning experience!",

      "From the moment I spoke with Brittany, I loved her energy and respected her voice. Throughout the entire planning process, Eventrics was really on top of it and helped us reach every deadline and overcome any obstacle. The platform they use with their clients to outline tasks per month is super organized and made me feel so much calmer during the process. I have a very Type A personality and this just gave me all the confidence in the Eventrics team. Abigail was our point person and really took the lead in helping us plan an amazing three day function. Due to our work schedule, planning during normal business hours is very difficult, but Abi was so flexible and really accommodated us by working around our schedules. Abi and Brittany advocated for what we wanted to our vendors and were able to re-visit subjects as many times as we needed in order to make us feel comfortable. We had a fusion Indian-Latin wedding with a Hindu Ceremony and Catholic Ceremony – the Eventrics team really showed their expertise in helping plan a fusion wedding, they gave us great ideas and followed up on any new ideas our families might have brought to the table. As the client, they really put you first and make sure that your vision is met. The Eventrics team worked so well with all my vendors and the vendors also commented on how amazing they are to work with. I learned that they really pay attention to the small details in the planning process which made all the difference in the end. Their execution of our events were flawless! We were always on time, any obstacle was handled with grace, they worked beautifully in coordinating vendors, took care of our families, and they always made sure that the Bride and Groom were happy and free from stress. I received numerous compliments from guests on their professionalism and work ethnic. An extra special thank you to Brittany and Abigail and the entire Eventrics Team in helping us have the most amazing wedding celebrations, we are forever grateful!!!",

We had gone through interviewing several companies prior but chose to work with Eventrics. Throughout the whole year of planning, they have helped countless hours in making sure every single event went smooth. Saajan and I were long distance during half of our wedding planning and we are truly grateful Eventrics team were able to help us with all of our venue sorting, choosing vendors, and assisting in any minor details needed to be accomplished. We used the Monday board which was extremely helpful and very organized that kept us on track with tasks we needed to complete. During the wedding week, we felt zero stress since we had Eventrics handling anything that was happening which very much helped us enjoy our weekend. Our wedding week went flawless and we truly had an amazing time. We wouldn't have had this amazing & stress-free of a wedding without Eventrics. Thank you so much for truly helping me and Saajan get our dream wedding. We truly appreciate you guys!",

      "Brittany and the Eventrics team were able to pull off what we thought was impossible: a cross country destination wedding, over three days, at three very unique venues – and all in under four months!Having witnessed their seamless work during my own sister's wedding, I knew when the time came, I wanted Eventrics as my planning team. I, personally, did not have a vision when it came to the planning process and their experience, guidance & immense knowledge on everything from venues, decor, vendors, timing, etc was so helpful in creating a wedding weekend that felt unique and special to us as a couple. Brittany and Abi are also great communicators; I felt comfortable to voice any concerns, questions, or vision/ideas and knew they would be taken into consideration and planned for accordingly.As a dynamic and all encompassing team, they successfully took the stress out of wedding planning. We still have guests commenting on how smoothly everything ran, and more importantly, how relaxed we were as the bride and groom. It was a relief knowing their expert team was managing all the moving parts and were the main point of contacts – which allowed us and our families to really enjoy the events we put so much thought into. Working with Eventrics was the first and easily the best decision we made throughout the wedding planning process.The level of detail and professionalism they put into EVERYTHING is what sets the team apart. I cannot recommend Eventrics highly enough to any couple looking to plan the best weekend of their life.",

They guided every step of the way from helping us find our vendors to negotiating our contracts to working collaboratively with the resort to get us the services needed to meet all our wedding needs.Brittany and the team are incredibly knowledgeable about and experienced with Indian weddings. There were multiple occasions where the team actually reminded us about some tradition aspects and rituals. Beyond this, Eventrics has figured out what it means to be organized. They use the platform Monday which basically houses a very organized and specific to-do list. It helped us keep track of which tasks needed to be done every week and every month. They were in communication with us and would have touch base calls with us at least once a week to make sure we were on track for everything from save the dates, outfits to dance choreography.During the wedding week, Brittany and the team were on top of everything and our wedding week went so smoothly. Our families and guests all said this was one of the most organized weddings they have attended! Eventrics is a must hire for planning your wedding and we are so happy we decided to choose them! ",

Everyone came up to us after the wedding and stated how effortlessly things ran, and how much things were on time, something they had never seen before. All thanks to Brittany, Whitney and Abi. They were our life savers that weekend. They handled everything so well and told our entire family where to be and what to do, and all we had to do was show up. They even went and got me gum because I wasn't feeling well. Overall, my wedding was such a success and I'm so glad we hired them. My entire family will hire them in the future for family weddings.

      "Eric and I are so grateful we chose Eventrics Weddings to help us plan our wedding. We interviewed about 8-10 different planners, and as soon as I met Brittany on that first Zoom call, I knew this was the right team for us. We chose them before finalizing our wedding venue, and I am so glad we did! Not only were they so knowledgeable in planning Indian weddings, but they were also willing to help create new ideas. Being a Catholic Hindu fusion wedding, we wanted to make sure both cultures were seen and experienced. Brittany and her team, from the very beginning, kept us on track with weekly/monthly phone calls and to-do lists and made sure we were not taking on more than we needed to when it wasn't due yet. So many people asked how we were feeling with the wedding planning process, and they were all surprised every time we commented that it's been great and we feel stress-free. This is all thanks to Brittany and her team.We had our wedding in Mexico, and they were innovative enough to find people that could help with any language barriers. They worked seamlessly with all our vendors and were resourceful when things came up that we couldn't get in America and had to source locally. There were so many things I felt I was asking which was out of the ordinary but they never let on and always said if it was possible they would do their best to achieve it. They gave us wonderful ideas on decor, florals, and how to achieve a beautiful culturally blended wedding. Britt, Eric and I cannot thank you (and the rest of your team) enough for the absolute perfection and dream of our wedding weekend! We couldn't have done it without you all. We received so many compliments on how amazing and well-organized our wedding was (and the fact that it started on time despite being an Indian wedding) and that's a lot thanks to you all. Britt, I know you handled so much behind the scenes and I'm sure there were a lot of mishaps happening but you kept us so stress-free all weekend and we appreciate that and appreciate you. Eric and I are truly grateful for all your efforts. From our eyes, everything turned out great!! Thank you again!!! I highly recommend this team for your own wedding planning if you want it to be organized, timely, and highly stress-free!",

The teams professionalism and organization kept us on task throughout the year of wedding planning and the weekend itself went incredibly smooth. My family and I didn't have to worry about a thing, as Brittany and her team handled every small and large detail there was. Every vendor we spoke with and hired reaffirmed that Brittany was the best in the industry as well! Unfortunately, our original wedding venue in Fort Myers became flooded due to Hurricane Ian 2 weeks before our wedding day and Brittany seamlessly stepped in and handled the venue switch to Orlando with all of our vendors, leaving us with no stress despite the circumstances.

      "I do not know where to even start with this wonderful team. We were skeptical about hiring a full-service event planner and were originally going to hire just a day of coordinator for our wedding because we thought we could handle the planning ourselves, but we felt a sense of ease from the second we talked to Brittany and knew that we needed to hire them as a full-service event planner, and I am so glad we did because the wedding would have been a hot mess without them. They used the Monday Platform to make sure we knew what tasks we needed to get done each month, which allowed us to be organized and confident throughout the wedding planning process. They were also in constant communication through the Monday board about these tasks and updated us with any pertinent information. They even brought up points that we would never have thought about or considered if we were doing the planning on our own, but they have tons of knowledge due to their past experiences. Our families said it was the most organized wedding that they have ever attended! EVERYTHING was on time, which as we know is rare for a South Asian event. Since they have been in the event planning business for so long, they have very strong relationships with vendors, which helped us tremendously during our search for a DJ, hair & makeup, food, and decor. Everyone they recommended to us ended up being amazing and the vendors themselves were happy to hear that Eventrics was our wedding planning team because they have always had a positive experience with them. As I am sure all couples experience during wedding planning, we did have some hiccups along the way with our venue and vendors, but Eventrics was always right there by our side guiding us and assuring us that we will get through all the obstacles and have an amazing wedding and THEY DID NOT DISSAPOINT!
